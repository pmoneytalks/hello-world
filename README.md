# hello-world
My First Line of Code
My Name is Precious Nwanganga
I'm trying out practically my coding skills on GitHub.
Been working mostly with HTML on WordPress and Blogger but decided to get deep and learn how to code with Java and NativeScript.
I really want to create stuff that can solve problems in my environment and maybe someday even change the world!
